<h1>About the Captain Awkward flashcards game</h1>

<p>
The questions and answers are copied or paraphrased from the excellent <a href="http://captainawkward.com">Captain Awkward</a> advice column / blog. The actual Captain Awkward and her co-authors weren't involved in making this game. The answers might or might not be helpful to you, since they are copied or paraphrased out of the original context, and at any rate an answer that's right for one person might not work for another. Definitely take it with a grain of salt!

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Why flashcards?</h2>

<p>
Captain Awkward is a hacker of of human interactions: she takes them apart, figures out how they work, writes scripts to make them work better, and shares these scripts with the world. But changing habits and behaviours is really hard - sometimes I read something and think "Aha, <em>that's</em> what I should do next time I'm in that situation!!!" And yet when the situation actually comes up I fall back on my old behaviour patterns, because in order to change you have to practise. Practise could mean role-playing, or practising in front of a mirror, or even just running through the situation a few times in your head, which is what a flashcards game prompts you to do.

<p>
Also, I think this would make a hilarious drinking game.
