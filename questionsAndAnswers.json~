At business events he acts as though he's your closest friend, tells you personal things about himself that you'd rather not know, and tries to create public drama and conflict so that he can position himself as your 'rescuer'. Not only is this extremely awkward for your, you worry that it's harming your professional development, so you decide to send him and email that will get him to back right off. What do you write?",
"a":"'_______, this is awkward, but I prefer to not interact with you at future meetings of the (group). Your behavior at past meetings has made me very uncomfortable, and I am certain that I do not want to be friends or have any kind of social or professional relationship with you. So next time we see each other at (events), let's say  a speedy, polite hello and then focus on meeting and catching up with other members.' <a href='http://captainawkward.com/2013/01/18/434-just-me-and-my-shadow-trying-to-network/'>Source</a>"},
