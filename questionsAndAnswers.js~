{"q":"You're on a first date with someone you met over the Internet. Your date is very nice, but you aren't sure whether you like them enough to want to see them again. Your date says: &quotI had a great time, how about we do this again next weekend?&quot What do you say in reply?","a":"&quotHey, thanks for asking.  I had fun tonight, but do you mind if I think about it and call you in a day or so?&quot","url":"http://captainawkward.com/2011/03/23/the-art-of-no/"},

{"q":"You're on a date that is just winding up. The evening has been mutually enjoyable and you suggest another meeting in a few days' time.

How do you respond?","a":"&quotOkay, sorry to hear it.&quot","url":"http://captainawkward.com/2011/03/23/the-art-of-no/"},

{"q":"You're on a first date with someone you met over the Internet. Your date seems like a perfectly nice person, but you aren't feeling it and you don't want to see them again.

{"q":"An expensive dinner invitation comes through - your friends are in town and they really want to try this one restaurant that just got written up in the New York Times. Money is tight for you at the moment and this dinner would cost way more than your weekly 'going out' budget.","a":"That sounds awesome, but I can’t make it that night.  Can we meet for (breakfast / coffee / a free or cheap fun thing) tomorrow instead?","url":"http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/13/first-reader-question-friends-with-money/"},

{"q":"You are attracted to a good friend. You would like to ask them out, but you're worried about spoiling the friendship.","a":"I've been afraid to ask you out because I don’t want to ruin our friendship, but I really like you and would love to take you on a date. Would you be up for that?","url":"http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/08/the-power-of-vulnerability/"},

{"q":"You would like to start a conversation with a cute person at (workplace / school / table tennis club / other).","a": "(HELLO, MY NAME IS + COMPLIMENT + QUESTION). For example: &quoteHi, I’ve seen you here (in the Medieval Manuscript collection of the library) a few times.  I really like your antique fountain pen.  Where did you buy it?&quote", "url":"captainawkward.com/2011/01/14/reader-question-3-a-shy-guy-caught-my-eye/"},

{"q":"You recently unfriended someone you know on Facebook, and they sent you a long email saying that you were wrong to unfriend them, and telling you how angry and hurt this made them feel. You don't dislike this person, you just didn't want to be their friend on Facebook anymore. How do you respond?", "a":"I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but I was not enjoying our online interactions very much and would prefer to just catch up with you at parties/at the holidays/at work/whenever I run into you.  Take care.", "url":"http://captainawkward.com/2011/02/04/the-book-of-the-face/"},

I had to give it a shot.","url":"http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/26/the-year-of-living-awkwardly/"},

{"q":"You have a friend who hugs you every so often. You don't like being hugged but you haven't said anything about it so far, but you're getting tired of gritting your teeth through the unwanted hugging. What could you say to your friend next time they (try to) hug you?" , "a":"I’m sure you don’t mean to make me uncomfortable, and I should have said something sooner, but you’re overdoing it with the hugs. Please stop.", "url":"http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/25/reader-question-13-dont-stand-so-close-to-me/"},

{"q":"You have recently started dating someone new. The sex is great and you enjoy hanging out with this person, but you definitely see it as a casual relationship, and you don't see this person being part of your life in the long-term. Lately they have been talking about introducing you to their family and getting married, which makes you uncomfortable. What can you say next time the topic of marriage comes up?", "a":"When you talk about marriage it makes me uncomfortable.  I don’t see this going there, and even if it were, it’s way too early to tell.  When you keep bringing it up or pushing me to meet your family before the time is right, I question your ability to just date and enjoy what we have.","url":"http://captainawkward.com/2011/02/25/reader-question-22-im-living-out-the-european-remake-of-500-days-of-summer/"},

{"q":"You live in a townhouse with very poor sound insulation, and your neighbours sound like howler monkeys when they have sex, which usually happens at around 4am. They tend to have several bouts of half an hour on, half an hour off, which is just enough time to start to doze off, then get woken up again. This has been going on for almost two years. Part of the reason you haven't said anything before is that your neighbours are violent people and you're scared of them. You decide to write them a note and slip it under their door. What should the note say?", "a":"Dear Neighbor: We’ve been hearing some loud noises late at night (4am-ish) and they are waking us up. Can you keep it down? Thank you, Your neighbors", "url":"http://captainawkward.com/2011/04/04/reader-question-33-tone-down-the-devils-orchestra-2/"}
