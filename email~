Dear Captain Awkward,

I'm a huge fan of your blog and I had an idea that it would be neat to re-package some Captain Awkward wisdom in the form of a flash-card game. I wanted to check if you are OK with this? For now it is at URL, and I haven't told anyone about it yet. There isn't much to it yet because I wanted to check with you before going further with it, but you can get the general idea. I'd be happy to hear about anything you want to change about it. And I'll understand if you're not into the idea.

Thanks,
Katie
